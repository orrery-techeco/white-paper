# The Orrery Project: A Vision for User-Centric Computing

## Manifesto: The "Why"

We exist in a digital world built by giants. Our devices, our software, and our data are planets orbiting stars that are not our ownâ€”behemoth corporations that define the rules of our digital lives. We are offered a choice between two extremes: the beautifully crafted but rigidly controlled "walled garden," or the chaotic, fragmented "open field" where seamless integration is a distant dream.

What if there was a third way?

Orrery is a new philosophy of computing built on a single, radical principle: **The user is the sun.** Every piece of hardware, every line of code, every interaction should revolve around the user's choice, control, and empowerment. It is not about building another operating system or another phone; it is about fundamentally re-architecting the relationship between people and their technology.

This document is the blueprint for that vision. It is a call to build an ecosystem that is open by default, integrated by design, and powerful by choice.

## The Core Technology: The Stellar Component Model (SCM)

To achieve true user-centricity, we need a common language that unifies the entire ecosystem. This language is the **Stellar Component Model (SCM)**.

The SCM's core principle is that **everything is a Component**. Whether it's a running application, a text file, a system service, or a button in the user interface, the system sees it as a self-contained, understandable block with a standard interface.

Every Component, regardless of its nature, adheres to a universal structure:

- **`Component.ID`**: A unique, human-readable identifier (e.g., `process.firefox`, `file./home/user/document.txt`).
- **`Component.State`**: Its current condition (`active`, `idle`, `error`).
- **`Component.Properties`**: A flexible list of its attributes (`memory_usage: 256MB`, `file_size: 1.2GB`).
- **`Component.Inputs` & `Component.Outputs`**: Defines how it connects and communicates with other components.

The SCM is the technical soul of Orrery. It dissolves the traditional barriers between applications and the operating system, creating a single, cohesive, and transparent software environment.

## The User Experience: Layered Control

The SCM empowers the user to interact with their digital universe at different layers of control, based on their needs and expertise.

- **GUI Layer ("Constellations"):** For most users, this is the beautiful and intuitive visual experience. A volume slider is simply a graphical way to change a `Property` of the master audio `Component`. Users can arrange these visual elements to create their own personalized desktops.
- **Shell Layer ("Gravity"):** For power users and developers, this is the ultimate nexus of control. The `Gravity` shell is a powerful, scriptable environment that can directly address any Component. It allows for automation and workflows that are impossible in traditional systems, all using a single, consistent language.
- **Hardware Layer ("Celestial Bodies"):** This represents the ultimate vision of modularity. While full hardware development is a long-term goal, the SCM is designed from day one to treat physical devices as first-class components, paving the way for a future of truly modular and repairable hardware.

## The Roadmap: An Invitation

The creation of Orrery is an immense undertaking that will only be possible as a community effort. Our roadmap is focused on delivering tangible software value at each stage.

- **Stage 1: The Paradigm.** Our entire focus is on proving the SCM. We will build a proof-of-concept version of the `Gravity` shell as a cross-platform application and foster a foundational community of contributors.
- **Stage 2: The Architecture.** With a successful `Gravity` shell, we will begin development on the first version of Orrery OS, integrating the SCM into the core of a custom Linux distribution.
- **Stage 3: The Ecosystem.** Once the OS is mature, we will develop the first "Galaxies" and explore the partnerships needed to bring the Orrery vision to dedicated hardware.

This is not a promise of a finished product. It is an invitation to an exploration. It is a call to developers, designers, and thinkers who believe in a more open, transparent, and empowering digital future.

If this vision resonates with you, join us. Let's build the software that will change the way we think about control.
